Common symptoms of long COVID include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction, headache, pain (e.g. chest pain, joint pain) and may have an impact on everyday functioning. There may be multi-organ effects or autoimmune conditions particularly in children. Symptoms may be new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate (change from time to time) or relapse (return of symptoms after period of improvement) over time. Although it is still unclear how long the symptoms may last, current research suggests that patients can improve with time. Some studies reported that long COVID is found more often in people who had severe COVID-19 illness, but anyone (including those with mild illness) can experience this condition after infected with COVID-19. According to WHO, COVID-19 vaccination can reduce incidence of long COVID. Some studies also suggested vaccinated persons are less likely to develop long COVID even they get infected, compared to the unvaccinated.',\n","  'Post COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS- CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.

Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time.',\n","  'Studies show that around 10â€“20% of people infected by SARS-CoV-2 may go on to develop symptoms that can be diagnosed as long COVID. Although exact numbers of those living with the condition are uncertain, it is believed that more than 17 million people across the WHO European Region may have experienced it during the first two years of the pandemic (2020/21).

Evidence shows that it usually arises 3 months from the onset of COVID-19, with symptoms lasting at least 2 months. Long COVID affects all age groups, and symptoms can emerge in people who were previously fit and healthy. WHO has also received reports of the condition occurring more frequently in women than men. The condition can be debilitating, causing disabling symptoms and functional deficits. It can significantly impact peoples ability to work, engage and participate fully in family and community life.

Hello! Could you specify the condition you are facing?\n","Chatbot :  The most common symptoms of long COVID are extreme tiredness (fatigue), feeling short of breath, loss of smell, muscle aches. However, there are lots of symptoms you can have after a COVID-19 infection, including problems with your memory and concentration (brain fog), chest pain or tightness, difficulty sleeping (insomnia), heart palpitations, dizziness, pins and needles, joint pain, depression and anxiety, tinnitus, earaches, feeling sick, diarrhoea, stomach aches, loss of appetite, a high temperature, cough, headaches, sore throat, changes to sense of smell or taste and rashes.\n","Chatbot :  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. COVID-19 were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. The symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to symptoms of other illnesses, such as colds and flu. Most people feel better within a few days or weeks of their first COVID-19 symptoms and make a full recovery within 12 weeks. For some people, it can be a more serious illness and their symptoms can last longer.\n","Chatbot :  To avoid severe illness and sequelae of COVID-19 in children, parents should bring their children for COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible. The two COVID-19 vaccines currently being used in Hong Kong are safe and effective as supported by clinical data. Expert recommendations of the Joint Scientific Committee and the Expert Advisory Panel are as follows: a) Children from 6 months to 4 years old can be vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine, b) Children and adolescents between 5 and 17 years old can be vaccinated with the BioNtech vaccine or Sinovac vaccine.nThe first and second doses of Sinovac vaccine are separated by one month, and the second and third doses are separated by at least three months. The first and second doses of BioNTech vaccine are separated by two months, and the second and third doses are at least five months apart. The Hong Kong Department of Health and the Hong Kong Hospital Authority have a comprehensive medical information system to closely monitor the possible adverse reactions after vaccination. Parents can be reassured that the two COVID-19 vaccines used in children and adolescents are immunogenic, safe and effective as supported by the data collected by the ongoing monitoring system.\n","Chatbot :  Hello!
