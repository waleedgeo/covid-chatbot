Common symptoms of long COVID include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction, headache, pain (e.g. chest pain, joint pain) and may have an impact on everyday functioning. There may be multi-organ effects or autoimmune conditions particularly in children. Symptoms may be new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate (change from time to time) or relapse (return of symptoms after period of improvement) over time. Although it is still unclear how long the symptoms may last, current research suggests that patients can improve with time. Some studies reported that long COVID is found more often in people who had severe COVID-19 illness, but anyone (including those with mild illness) can experience this condition after infected with COVID-19. According to WHO, COVID-19 vaccination can reduce incidence of long COVID. Some studies also suggested vaccinated persons are less likely to develop long COVID even they get infected, compared to the unvaccinated.',\n","  'Post COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS- CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.

Although exact numbers of those living with the condition are uncertain, it is believed that more than 17 million people across the WHO European Region may have experienced it during the first two years of the pandemic (2020/21).

Evidence shows that it usually arises 3 months from the onset of COVID-19, with symptoms lasting at least 2 months. Long COVID affects all age groups, and symptoms can emerge in people who were previously fit and healthy. WHO has also received reports of the condition occurring more frequently in women than men. The condition can be debilitating, causing disabling symptoms and functional deficits. It can significantly impact peoples ability to work, engage and participate fully in family and community life.

Mode of transmission includes through respiratory droplets, contact of contaminated surfaces or objects, short-range aerosol or short-range airborne transmission. The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings. Most estimates of the incubation period range from 1 to 14 days, and some variants, such as the Omicron variant, may have even shorter incubation period of around 3 days.\n","Chatbot :  Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. In some cases, you might continue to have a cough or feel tired after your other symptoms have improved, but this does not mean that you are still infectious.\n","Chatbot :  Can you please share details why you think that\n","Chatbot :  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. COVID-19 were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. The symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to symptoms of other illnesses, such as colds and flu. Most people feel better within a few days or weeks of their first COVID-19 symptoms and make a full recovery within 12 weeks. For some people, it can be a more serious illness and their symptoms can last longer.\n","Chatbot :  Some people become infected but dont develop any symptoms and dont feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. You should get plenty of rest and drink water to keep hydrated. You can use medications such as paracetamol to help with your symptoms. Antibiotics are not recommended for viral respiratory infections because they will not relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery.\n","Chatbot :  Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.

Complications may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multi-organ failure including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys. There are reports that children and adolescents with COVID-19 may develop a rare but serious condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), leading to multiorgan failure and shock.
