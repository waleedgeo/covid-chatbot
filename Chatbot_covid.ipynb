Common symptoms of long COVID include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction, headache, pain (e.g. chest pain, joint pain) and may have an impact on everyday functioning. There may be multi-organ effects or autoimmune conditions particularly in children. Symptoms may be new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate (change from time to time) or relapse (return of symptoms after period of improvement) over time. Although it is still unclear how long the symptoms may last, current research suggests that patients can improve with time. Some studies reported that long COVID is found more often in people who had severe COVID-19 illness, but anyone (including those with mild illness) can experience this condition after infected with COVID-19. According to WHO, COVID-19 vaccination can reduce incidence of long COVID. Some studies also suggested vaccinated persons are less likely to develop long COVID even they get infected, compared to the unvaccinated.','Post COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS- CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction but also others which generally have an impact on everyday functioning. Symptoms may be new onset, following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time.','Studies show that around 10–20% of people infected by SARS-CoV-2 may go on to develop symptoms that can be diagnosed as long COVID. Although exact numbers of those living with the condition are uncertain, it is believed that more than 17 million people across the WHO European Region may have experienced it during the first two years of the pandemic (2020/21). While common symptoms of long COVID can include fatigue, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction over 200 different symptoms have been reported that can have an impact on everyday functioning.','Post COVID-19 condition, also known as long COVID, can arise irrespective of the severity of the COVID-19 infection, the circulating variant of the virus, or the person’s age. Evidence shows that it usually arises 3 months from the onset of COVID-19, with symptoms lasting at least 2 months. Long COVID affects all age groups, and symptoms can emerge in people who were previously fit and healthy. WHO has also received reports of the condition occurring more frequently in women than men. The condition can be debilitating, causing disabling symptoms and functional deficits. It can significantly impact peoples ability to work, engage and participate fully in family and community life. Mental health effects can directly result from long COVID, but may also develop due to prolonged suffering and distress caused by the condition.','Post COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months, that cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.

Symptoms may be new onset, following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode, or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time.','The most common symptoms of long COVID are extreme tiredness (fatigue), feeling short of breath, loss of smell, muscle aches. However, there are lots of symptoms you can have after a COVID-19 infection, including problems with your memory and concentration (brain fog), chest pain or tightness, difficulty sleeping (insomnia), heart palpitations, dizziness, pins and needles, joint pain, depression and anxiety, tinnitus, earaches, feeling sick, diarrhoea, stomach aches, loss of appetite, a high temperature, cough, headaches, sore throat, changes to sense of smell or taste and rashes.','Recovery from long COVID varies. Some symptoms can improve quickly and others last longer. The chances of having long-term symptoms does not seem to be linked to how ill you are when you first get COVID-19. People who had mild symptoms at first can still have long-term problems.','Seek medical care for post-COVID conditions if you have a fever over 100.4 F, if you cannot take care of your symptoms at home, and/or if you are not recovering from your initial COVID-19 illness. In general, its important to talk to a medical provider when your symptoms make your daily life harder, for example, if you cant focus, sleep, or do your normal activities.

Common symptoms of long COVID include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction, headache, pain (e.g. chest pain, joint pain) and may have an impact on everyday functioning. There may be multi-organ effects or autoimmune conditions particularly in children. Symptoms may be new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate (change from time to time) or relapse (return of symptoms after period of improvement) over time. Although it is still unclear how long the symptoms may last, current research suggests that patients can improve with time. Some studies reported that long COVID is found more often in people who had severe COVID-19 illness, but anyone (including those with mild illness) can experience this condition after infected with COVID-19. According to WHO, COVID-19 vaccination can reduce incidence of long COVID. Some studies also suggested vaccinated persons are less likely to develop long COVID even they get infected, compared to the unvaccinated.',\n","  'Post COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS- CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.

Long COVID affects all age groups, and symptoms can emerge in people who were previously fit and healthy. WHO has also received reports of the condition occurring more frequently in women than men. The condition can be debilitating, causing disabling symptoms and functional deficits. It can significantly impact peoples ability to work, engage and participate fully in family and community life.

Common symptoms of long COVID include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction, headache, pain (e.g. chest pain, joint pain) and may have an impact on everyday functioning. There may be multi-organ effects or autoimmune conditions particularly in children. Symptoms may be new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate (change from time to time) or relapse (return of symptoms after period of improvement) over time. Although it is still unclear how long the symptoms may last, current research suggests that patients can improve with time. Some studies reported that long COVID is found more often in people who had severe COVID-19 illness, but anyone (including those with mild illness) can experience this condition after infected with COVID-19. According to WHO, COVID-19 vaccination can reduce incidence of long COVID. Some studies also suggested vaccinated persons are less likely to develop long COVID even they get infected, compared to the unvaccinated.\",\"Post COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS- CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction but also others which generally have an impact on everyday functioning. Symptoms may be new onset, following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time.\",\"Studies show that around 10–20% of people infected by SARS-CoV-2 may go on to develop symptoms that can be diagnosed as long COVID. Although exact numbers of those living with the condition are uncertain, it is believed that more than 17 million people across the WHO European Region may have experienced it during the first two years of the pandemic (2020/21). While common symptoms of long COVID can include fatigue, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction over 200 different symptoms have been reported that can have an impact on everyday functioning.\",\"Post COVID-19 condition, also known as long COVID, can arise irrespective of the severity of the COVID-19 infection, the circulating variant of the virus, or the person’s age. Evidence shows that it usually arises 3 months from the onset of COVID-19, with symptoms lasting at least 2 months. Long COVID affects all age groups, and symptoms can emerge in people who were previously fit and healthy. WHO has also received reports of the condition occurring more frequently in women than men. The condition can be debilitating, causing disabling symptoms and functional deficits. It can significantly impact people\\'s ability to work, engage and participate fully in family and community life. Mental health effects can directly result from long COVID, but may also develop due to prolonged suffering and distress caused by the condition.\",\"Post COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months, that cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.

Symptoms may be new onset, following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode, or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time.\",\"The most common symptoms of long COVID are extreme tiredness (fatigue), feeling short of breath, loss of smell, muscle aches. However, there are lots of symptoms you can have after a COVID-19 infection, including problems with your memory and concentration (brain fog), chest pain or tightness, difficulty sleeping (insomnia), heart palpitations, dizziness, pins and needles, joint pain, depression and anxiety, tinnitus, earaches, feeling sick, diarrhoea, stomach aches, loss of appetite, a high temperature, cough, headaches, sore throat, changes to sense of smell or taste and rashes.\",\"Recovery from long COVID varies. Some symptoms can improve quickly and others last longer. The chances of having long-term symptoms does not seem to be linked to how ill you are when you first get COVID-19. People who had mild symptoms at first can still have long-term problems.\",\"Seek medical care for post-COVID conditions if you have a fever over 100.4 F, if you cannot take care of your symptoms at home, and/or if you are not recovering from your initial COVID-19 illness. In general, it\\'s important to talk to a medical provider when your symptoms make your daily life harder, for example, if you can\\'t focus, sleep, or do your normal activities. Since many symptoms of post-COVID conditions are like symptoms of other diseases, it is also important to see a medical provider to rule out other illnesses.\"]',\n","  744: nan,\n","  745: nan,\n","  746: nan,\n","  747: nan,\n","  748: nan,\n","  749: nan,\n","  750: nan,\n","  751: nan,\n","  752: nan,\n","  753: nan,\n","  754: nan,\n","  755: nan,\n","  756: nan,\n","  757: nan,\n","  758: nan,\n","  759: nan,\n","  760: nan,\n","  761: nan,\n","  762: nan,\n","  763: nan,\n","  764: '[\"COVID-19 vaccines are effective to protect people against COVID-19 disease, in particular severe illness and death. Vaccination is one of the most effective tools in the overall public health response to COVID-19. The combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) with vaccination will allow for maximum protection against the virus. With COVID-19 vaccines deployed, there is a need to continue NPIs, including good hand hygiene and wearing a mask in public, to reduce the risk of virus transmission. NPIs should continue to be followed by vaccinated individuals, as well as those who have not yet been vaccinated.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. COVID-19 were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. The symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to symptoms of other illnesses, such as colds and flu. Most people feel better within a few days or weeks of their first COVID-19 symptoms and make a full recovery within 12 weeks. For some people, it can be a more serious illness and their symptoms can last longer.\n","Chatbot :  Hello! Are you currently having COVID or did you recover from COVID?\n","Chatbot :  Greetings!
